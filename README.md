## Synopsis
This project contains code to run on an arduino connected to a external breadboard circuit with sound impact sensor, and drivers for an RGB LED strip. When the sensor registers a noise, a new color is randomly selected, modified by either a lightness or saturation shift, then is transitioned to via a fade, jump, or a strobe of random colors. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted by its onboard potentiometer. 

## Motivation
To create an elegant solution for dynamic lighting which responds to the music which is playing. 1
